## About Saiddit

![Saiddit Logo](https://i.imgur.com/xqzrvS6.png)

Saiddit is a social media platform where users will have the ability to share websites, posts and other content with other users that share the same interests or hobbies.

Saiddit is built using React and Express, a mere fraction of the full stack of technologies we learned in the coding bootcamp this project was created for.

## You can run Saiddit locally

First off make sure you have a local version of MongoDB running on your machine. This project will make a local database for you called `appDB`.

```
mongod
```

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in the root directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

After all installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Planned Improvements

- Hosting on a better platform
- Adding categories
- Better security for users and data
- Build up user base
- Custom profile photos
